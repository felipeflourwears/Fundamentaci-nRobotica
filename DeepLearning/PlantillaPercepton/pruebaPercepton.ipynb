Our goal is to obtain a set of weights *w* that accurately classifies each instance in our training set. In order to train our Perceptron, we iteratively feed the network our training data multiple times. Each time the network has seen the full set of training data, we say an epoch has passed. It normally takes many epochs until a weight vector _w_ can be learned to linearly separate our two classes of data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EYVOOpEfFxR4"},"source":["![Perceptron](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1K7olbB11mSfAwPmB8BeeRNe6XbuGSK4D)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YmywjsFM8GF-"},"source":["The pseudocode is the following:\n","1.
